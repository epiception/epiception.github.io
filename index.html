		<p>Hi! I'm a Research Assistant at the <a href="http://robotics.iiit.ac.in/">Robotics Research Center, IIIT-H</a>. My interest lies at the intersection of Computer Vision, Machine Learning (Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning) and Robotics.</p>

		<p>In the past, I've had the opportunity to work as an Associate Researcher and Developer at <a href="http://swaayatt-robots.com/">Swaayatt Robots, India</a> on a self-driving vehicle prototype for Indian Roads. I finished my undergraduate studies in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Mumbai.</p>
